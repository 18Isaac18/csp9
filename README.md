Master Teachers: The GitHub PLTWCS/csp9 repository was being modified at the time this Cloud9 workspace was cloned. You will want to create a new workspace by following the Lesson 2.1 Supplement Part III at a later time. The workspace you have created from this commit of the PLTWCS/csp9 repo can be used to experiment, but it does not correctly implement the database for Lesson 2.2. Before using Cloud9 in Core Training, delete this Cloud9 workspace and repeat Part III of the Lesson 2.1 Supplement.
