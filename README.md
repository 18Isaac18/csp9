Materials for PLTW Computer Science Principles for Cloud9
# Under Contruction.
Master Teachers: The GitHub PLTWCS/csp9 repository was being modified at the time this Cloud9 workspace was cloned. You will want to follow the Lesson 2.1 Supplement at a later time. The workspace you have created from this commit of the PLTWCS/csp9 repo can be used to experiment, but it does not correctly implement the database for Lesosn 2.2. Before Core Training, delete this Cloud9 workspace and repeat Part III of the Lesson 2.1 Supplement.
