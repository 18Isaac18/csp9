As instructed in Part III of the Lesson 2.1 Supplement, please type three commands at the Bash prompt below. After each command, press enter and wait for the prompt to appear again.

 * `chmod 711 initialize.sh`
 * `./initialize.sh`
 * `sudo ./setup2.sh`

The `(master)` in the Bash prompt is git-related; The `initialize.sh` script will change your `.bashrc` file so that the Bash prompt of any Bash shells you open in the future will not show the git branch. 

Before using Cloud9 in Core Training for Lesson 2.2, delete this Cloud9 workspace and repeat Part III of the Lesson 2.1 Supplement.
